# Enterprise Software Development Recommended Resources

# What is it all about?

This repository contains my personal recommendations on enterprise software development resources. 
While my whole carreer has been devoted to development on Java which may have been influenced my choices 
I do my best here to recommend technology agnostic resources only. 
The majority of recommendations can be named "classics" or are written by "classic" authors in my opinion.
Although some information from the mentioned "classical" resources may be slightly out-of-date the remaining
material is still extremely useful and worth reading by every software developer IMHO.

# File Format

I use mind maps in FreeMind format (mm). It can be opened by either original FreeMind software (http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) or 
any modern tool having integration with FreeMind (e.g. https://www.xmind.net/).
